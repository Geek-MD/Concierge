# Concierge Server (Backend)

This repository provides the complete backend pipeline for the **Home Assistant custom integration: Concierge**, which tracks and exposes the official water pricing information for different regions, companies, and locations in Chile.

The backend is responsible for scraping, downloading, parsing, and structuring water tariff data published by the **Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios (SISS)**.

---

## 🧠 What This Does

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Scrapes the official SISS tariff page** to detect updates.
2. **Hashes the page content** and checks for changes using the `Last-Modified` header and content checksum.
3. **Downloads updated PDF files** containing water pricing regulations.
4. **Parses the new PDFs** using heuristics to extract key information from variable PDF layouts.
5. **Generates structured JSON files** with sectioned data:
   - General information
   - Fixed charges
   - Variable tariffs (potable water, wastewater, etc.)
   - Special charges (cut, reconnection, RILES, etc.)
6. **Outputs all processed data to a standardized directory**, ready to be used by the Home Assistant integration.

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### Build and Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The container will automatically:

1. Run `scraper.py` to check for changes.
2. If changes are detected, run `download_pdfs.py`.
3. If new PDFs were downloaded, run `parse_pdfs.py`.

---

## ⏰ Cron Job (Inside Container)

To automate the process at 3:00 AM on Sundays and Wednesdays, add this to the container’s crontab:

```cron
0 3 * * 0,3 python3 /app/scripts/scraper.py >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
```

Make sure your Dockerfile sets up the cron daemon and keeps the container alive.
